### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**jadebarclay/jadebarclay** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started: -->

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my PhD in oxforddown (with $LaTeX$ \todonotes) 
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m learning Quarto and teaching digital skills to health researchers 
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on hEDS stats and health data equity projects
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about PhD Cafe, where we can geek out/code/chat/commisserate together
